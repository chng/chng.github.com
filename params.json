And now I am a graduated student in Dalian University of Technology. I am a LinuxC/C++ programmer. My research interests includes wireless access control and wireless network measurement, especially with physical layer information. \r\n\r\n### Main Research Project\r\nBing Xian, Zhicheng Zeng, Lei Wang, Brian Peck, and Daji Qiao. CLaWa: Crowdsourced Location Aware Wi-Fi Access Control. \r\n\r\nWe have build a real-time platform to collect the channel state information. With this abundant information from the physical layer, we design location distinction models to enhance the wireless access control security. \r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nZhicheng Zeng, Ming Zhu, Hong Yu, Honglian Ma.
